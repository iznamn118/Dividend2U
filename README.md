## 📱 About the App
**Dividend 2 U** is a native Android application designed to help investors calculate their returns from Unit Trust investments. It was developed as an individual assignment for the **Mobile Technology and Development** course.

The app accurately calculates:
* **Monthly Dividend:** `(Annual Rate / 12) × Invested Fund`
* **Total Dividend:** `Monthly Dividend × Duration (Months)`

It features a modern, responsive **"Mobile First"** UI built with Material Design components and a custom Purple & White theme.
